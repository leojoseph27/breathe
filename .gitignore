#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, if you have multiple developers using different operating systems, you may want to ignore it
Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   However, if you have multiple developers using different operating systems, you may want to ignore it
